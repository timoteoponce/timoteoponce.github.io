I must admit that I'm being sleeping for a while, in my personal life, in my career and left behind the goals that inspired me just a year ago.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dFVSau4hO5w/TkT-6Pyh9qI/AAAAAAAAA8g/bz_q7UJmxMs/s1600/freedom-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="222" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dFVSau4hO5w/TkT-6Pyh9qI/AAAAAAAAA8g/bz_q7UJmxMs/s320/freedom-1.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />But some things changed during the last two months, I started doing things that changed my life. Small things that I thought were lame and not worth doing, here is a list of them:<br /><ul><li>I got high rates on my masters degree when I started losing interest on it.</li><li>Improved my jogging-resistance to 40 minutes just by practicing 3 times a week.</li><li>Solved very difficult (difficult for me) software-related problems at work, things that I never imagined that I could do.</li><li>Recover my reading-habit.</li><li>Found the way to drink enough not to get a killing-hangover, and also started enjoying these gathering events more and more.</li><li>Improved my personal relationships at all levels :-D </li></ul>And many other things that are just too lame to list...seriously. But after all I'm just doing what I used to do back in 2009, somehow I got lost in the way without even noticing it. I got too much comfortable with my situation, I couldn't think on getting my life to that frenetic pace again.<br /><br />But I was wrong, that frenetic pace kept me awake and living, I think now I recovered that energy that I always had.<br /><br />I will try to do the best I can with my life, I will make mistakes and be a total fool sometimes, but I'll learn from it. Because that's the only thing I'm sure I'm capable of...learning.<br /><br />I still have tons of things to do, to improve, to correct. So much things that I just started wrapping my mind around them, so expect more activity from now on.
