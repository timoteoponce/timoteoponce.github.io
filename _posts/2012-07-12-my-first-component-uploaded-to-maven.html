A few years ago I gathered this pagination component logic from a co-worker and changed it a little bit, adding some desirable functionality and reducing some external dependencies.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>I've used in several projects, web-oriented and desktop-based and it accomplishes its works, pagination.<br /><br />Today I spent a couple of hours configuring it for Maven Central, just to check if I could do it.<br /><br />So, here it is, my first component published on <a href="http://search.maven.org/">Maven Central</a> that can be used if you want to. I really like it and I encourage anybody to check it, review it, criticize it and trash it.<br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://timoteoponce.github.com/paginator/">Project page on github</a></li><li>Base code author - Rory Sandoval</li></ul>
