I'm a huge fan of conferences, I like documentaries and any kind of media that teaches something. And as a software developer I must say that there are lots of good resources for us to learn, to keep updated in technologies, concepts and general practices.<br /><br />One of the best presentations I've seen so far is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY">Alan Kay's keynote at OOPSLA 97</a>, I don't know if there are any transcripts of it, but it is very valuable to listen what the man has to say, recommended.<br /><br /><center><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/oKg1hTOQXoY" width="420"></iframe></center>
