I'm learning <a href="http://scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> as part of my masters thesis and every day I find something new that gets me more and more interested about this language.<br /><br />As I'm a technical guy I enjoy seeing things working, so hands down on the keyboard. Obviously the first attempt I do for any programming language is the classic <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program">Hello World</a>.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4242955.js"> </script><br /><br />They both compile to Java bytecode and work exactly the same, but I have to add some remarks on the few code I wrote:<br /><ul><li>There are no static things in Scala, they've been replaced by Singleton objects.</li><li>No semicolons, even though they are optional, it's kind of verbose.</li><li>I'm passing a function as a parameter, wow, that's powerful and much less verbose.</li><li>Those loops are awesome....</li><li>Much, but much less verbose. </li></ul>In summary, with this stupid code I've seen how powerful can Scala be without having to give up all the knowledge I have about Java, its compatible and they can coexist together.<br /><br />So, give it a try...
