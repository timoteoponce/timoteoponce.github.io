Although this book is kind of old, is still valid. All its concepts and best practices are still being used and its author is an authority in the development world &gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch">Joshua Bloch</a>.<br /><br />This was the first book I read when I got into professional development, and believe when I say that is one of the mandatory books to read if you want to write something functional in Java.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683">Effective Java at Amazon</a><br /><br />PS: I would like to share the ebook version of it, but I'm not sure about the licensing/copying policies.
