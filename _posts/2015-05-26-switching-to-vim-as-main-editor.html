During a normal day of work one gets into a lot of different tasks related to programming, documenting, writing, reading and so on.<br /><br />Multiple formats are handled by our fingers each day, and multiple things are done over and over and over. One of these things is editing, editing has been for a long time for me, essential.<br /><br />Editing text in different kind of files has had a lot of testing from my side, my requirements are quite simple:<br /><br /><ul><li>Multiple encoding support</li><li>dos-to-unix and viceversa editing&nbsp;</li><li>multi-window/panel split features</li><li>snippets</li><li>auto-completion</li><li>formatting</li><li>visualization</li><li>file-tree navigation</li></ul><div>You might say, these things are simple and you can fill them up with TextMate, Notepad++ or an IDE, and perhaps you're right, but not in my context.</div><div><br /></div><div>My context is development, of different kinds and different programming languages, so here you have some considerations/notes/remarks for the editors I've used:</div><div><ul><li><b>IDE</b>s: these are great, fully integrated, but I'm not always with the possibility to delegate 1GB of memory just to edit a simple &nbsp;YAML file.</li><li><b>High-end editors</b>: Such as TextMate, SublimeText and others. I have used them, and I have been pleased with their simplicity and user-interface. But sadly it doesn't satisfy my mental model since from time to time I have to work over an SSH connection with scripts.</li><li><b>Emacs and derivatives</b>: &nbsp;I love Emacs, and I love JED, but sadly such environments need (from my point of view) lots of effort to configure, setup, and even to keep it working for in a productive way for my needs. I use them from time to time, but they're not my first choice.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrishunt/dot-files/master/.screenshot.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrishunt/dot-files/master/.screenshot.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>So finally, I tried <a href="http://vim.org/">VIM</a>, it's a great tool, I cannot say if it's better than Emacs or others, but one thing I can say, it has a great community, the Ruby and Open Source communities in general have chosen <a href="http://vim.org/">VIM</a> and made a damn excellent environment out of it, this was not the case 5 years ago, things like:</div></div><div><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus distribution</a>: Great default-environment setup with lots of goodies.</li><li><a href="http://vimawesome.com/">Vim awesome</a>: The place to check plugins and extensions.</li><li><a href="http://vimcasts.org/">VimCasts</a>: Great learning resource.</li></ul><div>And others make it my first choice right now, it's kind of confusing at time to get the edition modes, but once switching for some hours it gets natural, <a href="http://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> is not only an editor, is a powerful edition environment that works really well, and it's mainly because of the community behind it.&nbsp;</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Got give it a try, or try Emacs, but as I was told by others, define your needs and pick the tool that applies to your context.</div>
