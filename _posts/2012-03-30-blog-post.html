As a software developer and avid reader, I tend to spend a lot of time sitting or laying down in a bed. And this is normal for my life, I would say that at least 10 hours in my normal day are based literally on my ass.<br /><br />When I started working I noticed this, and I knew I had to do something to keep my body as trained as my hands and brain were. So I decided to go back to an old costume I adopted while I was writing my thesis... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogging">jogging</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><br />Jogging is a very simple discipline where you set a target destination and run at a certain pace, fast enough to not be walking, slow enough to keep your stamina.<br /><br /><h4>The benefits</h4>These are personal facts, that might not apply to everybody:<br /><ul><li>Relaxation, it keeps you away from your daily problems for some hours, clearing your thoughts and mind.</li><li>Concentration, well... you need it, you have to control your legs, your breath, and your speed while checking what's in your way.</li><li>Fitness, it keeps your middle-body in a good shape, if you do it regularly.</li><li>Discipline, you need a lot of will to jog when it's raining, when it's cold, when it's hot.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>How much?</h4>After some years of irregular practice, I have set my jogging sessions to 30-45 minutes, it could be longer, but definitively not shorter.<br /><br /><h4>What about the speed?</h4>It depends completely on you, when I haven't done anything for a while I have to recover the muscles and pace I start slowly and then increase the speed day by day. As a metric, use your breath, if you get too tired or just too agitated, you might need to slow it down.<br /><br /><h4>How to keep it interesting?</h4>It could get bored, specially if you follow the same route for several days in a row. What I enjoy doing is listening to some <a href="http://timoponce.blogspot.com/2011/09/podcasts-i-enjoy-listening.html">podcasts</a> while running, or perhaps some music. For this situation a portable <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> is the best choice.
