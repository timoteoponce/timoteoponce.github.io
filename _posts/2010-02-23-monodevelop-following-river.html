Mono is a free implementation of .Net standard for Windows, GNU/Linux and some other platforms. Is compatible with .Net and has called my attention since its creation, I just needed the motivation of Miguel de Icaza to get into this.<br /><br />As I'm not a .Net developer, I wanted to learn it using C#, that looks like Java, but I wanted to start with Mono because of the portability feature, applications can run in different environments, and that's a lot. Almost all distributions support or provide Mono packages, and it has beautiful IDE called MonoDevelop, that might not be as complete as Visual Studio, but I really like it.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><br />I tried with desktop applications, that handle files and some XML processing and I have to say that is really interesting to see an application (binary) run in different environments without extra compilations.<br /><br />After many years of work, Ximian team and the community have make it, it works, and it has a very promisory future, I can't wait to see what they will do next.<br /><br />Links:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop </a>- you will find all related links here</li><li><a href="http://tirania.org/blog">Miguel de Icaza</a>, blog</li></ul>
