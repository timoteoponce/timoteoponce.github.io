Since I started working with JMX, I always had a background framework doing the dirty job for me. First it was <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/reference/jmx.html">Spring JMX</a> with all its utilities, it's impossible to describe how pleased I was with it. <br /><br />Then I worked in a web application, using JBoss, and again, all was as simple as adding an annotation string to some classes or operations.<br /><br />But recently I got involved in a pure-java application without frameworks and without the possibility of integrating one. As I was so pleased with the previous frameworks I used, I didn't want to waste time defining objects, creating and registering them.<br /><br />My brain doesn't like to work ... I needed a library.<br /><br />After a half hour search, I found a very interesting utility called <a href="http://commons.apache.org/modeler/">Apache Commons Modeler</a>, that claims to be the solution to my problem.<br /><br />Being myself a huge fan of all <a href="http://commons.apache.org/">Apache Commons</a> solutions, I have no doubt this will solve all my problems.<br /><br />To continue...
