<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><br />During the time I've being a software developer there are many things that I noticed in my personal growth as a programmer, I can quickly list the following phases/periods:<br /><ul><li><b>Beginner</b>: You do have notions for programming, but write awful code.</li><li><b>User</b>: You start writting better code, you also see your previous mistakes.</li><li><b>Experienced</b>: You know the ground, and you are comfortable with it. </li></ul>And the interesting thing about these phases is that are technology/language/paradigm based. What I mean with this is that you cycle through these phases every time you learn something new (at least in programming, in my personal case).<br /><br />First I learned structured programming, then object-oriented programming, then aspect-oriented programming, then functional-programming, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_context_and_interaction">DCI</a>. All of them in a different set of technologies and tools that completely changed what I thought I knew about programming. This is a learning pattern of mine that I know it works, every time I try to learn something new I know that these phases are going to be in the way.<br /><br />I kind of know now how I learn, and I can do something about it. Now it's simpler to learn something new, and at the moment this new thing is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">LISP</a> via <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, not sure what is gonna happen, but I can tell you that my brain is breaking old rules every week.<br /><br />I think that's the message for this post, know how you learn, then kick the shit out of your brain.
