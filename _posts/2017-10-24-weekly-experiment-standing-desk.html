After listening to some interesting thoughts from <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2015/09/se-radio-episode-238-linda-rising-on-the-agile-brain/">Linda Rising at Software Engineering Radio</a>, I've started a periodical experiment, time-boxed to a week in order to check results.<br /><br />So this weeks is related to standing desk, not really a standing desk, but a platform that allows me to work while standing up.<br /><br />The rules:<br /><ul><li>During mornings sitting will be the default&nbsp;</li><li>During afternoons standing will be the default</li><li>During lunch-time standing will be the default </li></ul>The control:<br /><ul><li>Did it have any physical effect?&nbsp;</li><li>Did it have any food/drink related effect?</li><li>Did it have any sleep-related effect?</li><li>Did it affect in any way productivity and awareness?</li></ul><br />
