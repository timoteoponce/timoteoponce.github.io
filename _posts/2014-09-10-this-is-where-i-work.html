Disclaimer: Draft from a long time ago. <br /><br />Back in December of 2009 I was preparing my thesis work for my graduation, and somehow a very funny guy called me saying that we have talked a while ago about a job offer in a software development company.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.swissbytes.ch/sites/all/themes/aaika/images/fullsite-img14.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.swissbytes.ch/sites/all/themes/aaika/images/fullsite-img14.jpg" height="299" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />At the beginning I was thrilled, I hadn't worked in a professional way by that moment, I couldn't talk nor understand English properly and I was very insecure about my skills against the European standards.<br /><br />But then I found out something, these guys were really interested in personal values above all, they might need skillful people, but it wasn't (and I dare to say it still isn't) the most important thing.<br /><br />We were a very small group, now a little bit larger, doing things I found challenging. There are several goals I have set for me in this workplace, I like working there, I enjoy the work I'm doing and the people whom I working with.<br /><br />Perhaps you want to <a href="http://swissbytes.ch/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=54">take a look at the website to know the company</a> a little bit ;-)
