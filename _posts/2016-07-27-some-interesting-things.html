During the last seven years I've been working as a software developer, ocasional team leader, weird tester and lazy seller.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8671/15646186494_5b99212368_o.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8671/15646186494_5b99212368_o.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />The world of software development is so wide and moving that you never get tired of it, I happen to dislike some technology approaches, some practices, and even some programming languages.<br /><br />But something I come to appreciate from the profession itself, is the self-pacing nature of it. It's possible to have great teams where things move really fast and well, and is also possible to get into a slow-as-a-snail situation in which you can't even see the final outcome.<br /><br />I've been in many kinds of teams, and I think I know how to create a working environment that helps to understand the problems, react to them and make things better, I have come to that state.<br /><br />I can't say that I'm the best developer, because I'm not, my role is closer to a problem-solver. That's why I've been investing some time looking for options in software development in which I can learn more, new problems, new challenges, and came across <a href="http://www.toptal.com/">TopTal</a>.<br /><br />Confession, I have heard of it while listening to <a href="https://changelog.com/">TheChangelog</a>, that ringed the bells for me, working from home is a nice incentive, now that I have a family, and the chance to work with people all over the world, is a hook for me. So, I'm looking forward to join it's <a href="https://www.toptal.com/software">development group</a>.<br /><br />I'm currently applying to see: how it is, how it works, what can I do in there, will it suit me?<br /><br />But only time and practice will say, let's see how it goes...<br /><br />Update: It didn't go that well :-), but it was a great opportunity to understand how little I know, and to try to learn new things
