Another weekend project has been released. As a short overview, one of the things I really love about <a href="http://git-scm.com/">GIT</a> it's the .gitconfig layout:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/676291.js">  </script><br /><br />I love the simplicity and the clearness of those configuration files, and I wanted something similar for some of my Java projects, but I couldn't find an implementation of it.<br /><br />So, I decided to create a very small library for supporting git-config file layout for Java. After a couple days of work, I have something I'm not ashamed of.<br /><br />But well, here you go: <a href="http://timoponce.blogspot.com/p/gitconfig4j.html">gitconfig4j project page</a>
