After a week trying this new setup for working, here the results.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.pei.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Standing-Desks.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="800" height="318" src="https://www.pei.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Standing-Desks.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />The rules:<br /><ul><li>During mornings sitting will be the default</li><li>During afternoons standing will be the default</li><li>During lunch-time standing will be the default</li></ul><br />The control:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Did it have any physical effect?</b>&nbsp;</li><ul><li>A big physical effect, the body feels better, although there were some small pains after the first days</li></ul><li><b>Did it have any food/drink related effect?</b></li><ul><li>Clearly, I consumed much less sugared drinks, not even coffee, and the body didn't ask for it.<b> </b></li></ul><li><b>Did it have any sleep-related effect?</b></li><ul><li>Not sure if related to this single event, but I've been sleeping better.<b> </b></li></ul><li><b>Did it affect in any way productivity and awareness?</b></li><ul><li>This was the biggest effect, procrastination decreased, interactions increased, awareness increase, hence productivity increased as well.</li></ul></ul>Result:&nbsp; This is a must-do practice, I'm going to extend it to full work-days and not only in the afternoons, the effects have been so noticeable that I can't avoid feeling weird by sitting down.<br /><br /><br />
