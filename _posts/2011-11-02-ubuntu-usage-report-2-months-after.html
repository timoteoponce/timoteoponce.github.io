So far I've been using <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> as my laptop's system for two months, did a lot of things with it, including serious applications development.<br /><br />For doing it so, I performed several package installations and system configurations, including very low-level scripting and server-oriented configurations.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p6btMVKH_J0/TrFcYKr3a7I/AAAAAAAAAO0/BpoUBi77eSk/s1600/Screenshot-ubuntu.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p6btMVKH_J0/TrFcYKr3a7I/AAAAAAAAAO0/BpoUBi77eSk/s400/Screenshot-ubuntu.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />Considering everything I did, this are some things I find very useful in Ubuntu:<br /><ul><li><b>Package management system</b>, this is perhaps its most obvious feature, it's really simple to install any package present in a repository.</li><li><b>User experience</b>, this is also something very well worked. The system is built to make user's life as simple as possible,</li><li><b>Boot speed</b>, it makes the difference.</li><li><b>Security updates</b>, very robust updates that don't break anything.</li><li><b>Software center</b>, a huge amount of software applications available for simple click-installations.</li><li><b>Huge community</b>, it's perhaps the biggest Linux community I've ever seen.</li></ul>But, it has some things that can get potential users away of it:<br /><ul><li><b>Dependency hell</b>, do you mean I have to install the entire open-jdk stack if I want to install Maven? even if I already have sun-jdk installed?</li><li><b>User constraints</b>, if you touch some system configurations that Ubuntu is keeping track of, you are going to have problems.</li><li><b>Configuration complexity</b>, <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> is a heaven compared to this.</li><li>Imposition, once you update the distribution, you will get your beloved desktop replaced by an <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/perlow/why-ubuntu-1110-fills-me-with-rage/19103">awful Unity</a> desktop.</li><li><b>Unofficial packages</b>, I had very rough moments try to install something Ubuntu doesn't support, I ended up compiling all the custom software I required.</li></ul><br />
