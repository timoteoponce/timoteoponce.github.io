I was having fun comparing the code I did in my early programming attempts in Java, and thought about how much would it take to rewrite it now, but in Ruby.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><br />As an initial attempt, I took the widely known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree">Binary tree</a>, I started with the test cases and then implemented the code for them, here's the result.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/2297852.js">  </script> <br />I can say that it took at least ~50% less effort compared to the Java implementation, and it looks good :-)
