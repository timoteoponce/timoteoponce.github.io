First of all, the mandatory disclaimer: I'm a <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java</a> developer and I have been one since 2006, I have some experience with it and I can tell that most of the things I tried have worked fine.<br /><br />Now, why if I have a stable knowledge on an existing programming language, and its frameworks, and its related tools, and its book and literature, want to learn a new language such as <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>?<br /><br /><i>- Well, the answer is simple, because sometimes you have to choose the right tool for your current context.&nbsp;</i><br /><br />Here are the some reasons that make Java kind of hard to work when developing something:<br />- It's compiled, so if I want to do something quick such as a prototype... it takes some effort.<br />- It's verbose, yes it is, especially if you compare it with languages such as Scala or Ruby.<br />- You need an IDE for it, perhaps this is not that bad after all, but sometimes you don't need to do something big or have a full-featured software behind your little project.<br />- Functional programming support is missing, I think new Java proposals <a href="http://blog.jelastic.com/2013/04/15/java-functional-programming/">have been taking this issue</a>, but it's still missing in the mainstream.<br /><br />Now a short list of some <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> features I really enjoy:<br />- Interpreted/Dynamic, you can type and run without problems.<br />- Wonderful syntax, even though I don't like the 'end' keyword, it is really nice to read code written with this syntax.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zpwlS4IPs1k/UXoCBA-TERI/AAAAAAAABY4/cxDgKybJdu8/s1600/Screen+shot+2013-04-26+at+12.26.05+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="268" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zpwlS4IPs1k/UXoCBA-TERI/AAAAAAAABY4/cxDgKybJdu8/s320/Screen+shot+2013-04-26+at+12.26.05+AM.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />- Functional programming support, I'm not sure how far it goes into this support, but blocks, mixins and some other features are quite interesting.<br />- Dependency management, you have <a href="http://rubygems.org/">Gems</a> and packages in a <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> or <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy">Ivy</a> style.<br />- Build tool, rake is quite good.<br />- Literature, there are lots of data about it in the net, it has a huge community and many experts around the world.<br /><br />That's the short list regarding my current choice on Ruby Learning, and I don't regret it. I have some projects to do in dozens of hours, they could not be possibly made without Ruby and wonderful frameworks such as <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> or <a href="http://datamapper.org/">DataMapper</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><br />You should learn a new language once on a while, because as the market is moving skills are required everywhere, and seeing what other people is doing will help you understand how good or bad you are<br />at doing things. Personally I have found many mistakes in my code and my concepts by checking what other people have done, and by finding them I have improved a little bit, week by week and month by month. That's the thing, keep yourself moving forward, always, and hopefully always improving :-)
