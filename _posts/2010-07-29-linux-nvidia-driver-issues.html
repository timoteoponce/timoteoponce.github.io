Sadly I have to talk about this again, since Slackware 12.2 I've been having problems with<br />my Nvidia GeForce 6400 card (I know it's old, shut up). And most of the times a little of<br />investigation and configuration would be enough, but not this time.<br /><br /><ul><li>Problem description: User switch action freezes all the system and the only way to restore it is by restarting it.</li></ul><ul><li>Affected OS: Ubuntu Linux 10.4, Slackware Linux 13.1</li></ul><br />As is not only affecting my Slackware installation, I'm pretty sure that is an issue with the kernel<br />module. For safety concerns (my information is important now), I'm forced to uninstall all<br />nvidia drivers and return to the legacy VESA drivers.<br /><br />Is not as good as it used to, but at least is quite stable.
