A while ago I read in many places that you should write down what you learn, and that the best way to do it is by having a personal wiki.<br /><br />So I started doing that, but at the time the options I had were:<br /><div><ul><li>Install a local server and then use MediaWiki or something similar</li><li>Install a standalone application that worked as a wiki</li><li>Use a public service to create a personal wiki</li></ul><div>But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get use to it, I worked most of the time offline, and I didn't like to be doing configurations over and over (since I still use a variety of OSes).</div></div><br />But during the last year I've been working on personal projects with <a href="http://fossil-scm.org/">Fossil SCM</a>, which is a great-scm created by the mind behind <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>, the great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Richard_Hipp">Dr. Richard Hipp</a>, you should listen to his talks, he's quite something.<br /><br />And with this standalone SCM that comes with an embedded wiki, I started creating content, of everything I had in mind:<br /><div><ul><li>Vim shortcuts</li><li>Daily logs</li><li>Small shell tweaks</li><li>Docker commands</li></ul><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ElDkY-iAbgE/VuLOH6EfMqI/AAAAAAAAB8k/mee7pdyPACMZXd52x9Izk4UwF4yxozXQg/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-03-11%2Bat%2B9.54.06%2BAM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="365" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ElDkY-iAbgE/VuLOH6EfMqI/AAAAAAAAB8k/mee7pdyPACMZXd52x9Izk4UwF4yxozXQg/s400/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-03-11%2Bat%2B9.54.06%2BAM.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">snapshot</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>And I'm having fun, this is great, the full-scm is a single binary, I don't need an environment, and is all versioned. I can rewind some things I did and restore old things. It's immensely useful for writing, fun for reading, and really concise.</div></div><br />If you are thinking on starting a personal wiki, I would strongly suggest you to consider <a href="http://fossil-scm.org/">Fossil-SCM</a>, you won't regret it.
