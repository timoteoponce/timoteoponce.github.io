<span style="font-size: large;">Precedents </span><br />While going to work or when I'm walking from work to the university, I tend to get bored. A year ago I got an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> due to some obscure business, but that's not the point of this story, and I got reallz interested in its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">Podcast</a> feature.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>Although it's just a radio program meant to be played in a mobile device, it is an amazing source of entertainment and information. I started listening podcasts about technology and engineering because of my English-level. But after some weeks of practice I started listening to some programs that I considered "advanced".<br /><br />In summary, here they are:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOSS_Weekly">FLOSS weekly</a>, an amazing show about open source projects. Randal Schwartz and his friends fill my Wednesdays with lots of information (you can check an outdated list of my favorites episodes in <a href="http://timoponce.blogspot.com/2010/09/floss-weekly-favourite-episodes.html">Floss weekly favourite episodes</a>).</li><li><a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">Software engineering radio</a>, great program about software engineering and technology.</li><li><a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/">This Developer's Life</a>, a very well produced show with very interesting topics, although in the last months there haven't been so many episodes, the existing ones are great. </li><li><a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">This American Life</a>, who is not listening to this show around the world right now?.</li><li><a href="http://smodcast.com/">SModcast network</a>, I'm a huge fan of Kevin Smith's work and his network of podcasts is just astonishing.</li><ul><li><a href="http://smodcast.com/channels/smodcast/">Smodcast</a>, Kevin and Scott Mosier.</li><li><a href="http://smodcast.com/channels/hollywood-babble-on/">Hollywood Babble-on</a>, Kevin and Ralph Garman.</li><li><a href="http://smodcast.com/channels/jay-silent-bob-get-old/">Jay and Silent Bob get old</a>, Kevin and Jason Mewes.</li></ul></ul>
