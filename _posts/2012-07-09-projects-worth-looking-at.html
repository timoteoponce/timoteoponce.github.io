For a while I've been reading about the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_archaeology">Software Archeology</a> from different media channels and I find it very valuable. Especially if you are trying to do something interesting with your projects, in those cases is a very good idea to checkout some very well written applications.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://zuskin.com/images/code_review_binary.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://zuskin.com/images/code_review_binary.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">Rails</a></span><br />If you want to see what <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> can do, this is the project I recommend. It has several gems in it, including a very complete documentation.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/">Guava</a></span><br />Google has released several open source projects with high quality code and lots of functionality, this set of libraries are great tools when dealing with real-life applications.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">Guice</a></span><br />A great CDI component that simplifies Spring into fine grained components that are extremely extensible. I use it whenever I can and it's really, but really cool.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="https://github.com/unclebob/fitnesse">Fitnesse</a></span><br />This is perhaps the application with more test coverage I've ever seen, a serious attempt to reduce the gap between user acceptance tests and testers. <br /><br />You might have noticed that most of them are written in Java, I didn't have time to check some other languages, but for sure Scala and Clojure are my next target.<br /><br /><h3>References </h3><ul><li><a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2009/11/episode-148-software-archaeology-with-dave-thomas/">se-radio: Software Archeology</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/repositories">Interesting repositories at github</a></li></ul>
