This is not a rant, really, just a some few things I would like to write down.<br /><br /><h2>History</h2>When I started into development I've got the great suggestion to use revision control systems, the first one that I ever used was <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs">CVS</a>, it really worked well for my own purposes, just had some issues with the sharing-between multiple machines.<br /><br />Then Subversion was the hot-thing and it was a bit better that <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>, but still had some of the things that I disliked from CVS.<br /><br />Then <a href="https://git-scm.com/">GIT</a> showed up, the projects I was working on required CVS, so I got an early non-official version of git-svn and started working with it, it was great, so many of my problems went away, but it was still under a SVN server.<br /><br />After that , Github, Bitbucket, Kiln, and the tipping point, everybody switched to the reasonable choice, distributed revision control systems, and I think the best summary for why this approach is better than others, is described by <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2010/03/17.html">Joel</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sysUll2dt2Q/XTx5_xjWjxI/AAAAAAAAIHI/iwtlXa-QBIg7qPetqvKNssLm-We4dshFQCLcBGAs/s1600/hg.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="499" data-original-width="384" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sysUll2dt2Q/XTx5_xjWjxI/AAAAAAAAIHI/iwtlXa-QBIg7qPetqvKNssLm-We4dshFQCLcBGAs/s320/hg.jpg" width="246" /></a></div><br /><h2>My point</h2><br />My point is not to tell which tool is technically better, my point is more subjective, I think that Git is still technically the most advanced approach you can have for revision control systems, but it might not be the most simple one to use.<br /><br />I have used a lot of tools, and among all of them the one that still holds my thumbs up is <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/">Mercurial</a>, here some few reasons:<br /><ul><li>Simple and concise user interface (commands)</li><li>Better merging strategies</li><li>No automatic commits on merge</li><li>Good performance</li><li>Simple to explain</li><li>Gentle learning curve</li><li>Consistent tooling&nbsp;</li></ul>&nbsp;Not too many reasons, rights? that's why I like it, because it just works, no porcelain/plumbing, just the tool. The other tool that goes beyond this is Fossil SCM, but it still needs adoption.<br /><br />So in the end, my suggestion, if you are using revision control systems and you are unhappy with Git, or you don't know any other tool, give Mercurial a try.
