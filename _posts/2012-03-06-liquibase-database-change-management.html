When you are developing an application, is almost sure that you will have to deal with a relational database system. And if you are developing with a 'refactoring' point of view, your database structure will change from time to time.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><br />In many situations these changes have to be tracked and automatically applied for the different environments (development, integration, production) and I bet you are currently doing that manually, updating scripts and wiping databases back and forth.<br /><br />This is no longer the case for me, a while ago I started using <a href="http://www.dbunit.org/">DBUnit</a> for managing my database data changes, but as the development moved forward, the database structure changed as well. So we started looking for a tool that could simplify our lives.<br /><br />Guess where we found it, in the<a href="http://www.dbunit.org/faq.html"> DBUnit FAQ page</a>, they even recommend it!. The tool is <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/">Liquibase</a>, a java-based application that uses XML changesets to handle the database modifications, it works smoothly and support almost all productive database systems.   It might be a little bit hard in the beginning, but it is worth it.
