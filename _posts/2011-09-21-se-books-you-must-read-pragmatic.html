Once I started working of professional software development, I was eager to learn what the world was doing at the time. I had left university and working for a considerable payment was new for me, I wanted to deserve it.<br /><br />Then I started reading a lot, several books about programming an engineering, some of them were obsolete and a complete waste of time. But every once I found a jewel, and this is a very good one:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://petdance.com/perl/great-non-oreilly-books/pragmatic-programmer.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://petdance.com/perl/great-non-oreilly-books/pragmatic-programmer.jpg" width="253" /></a></div><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>Every person getting into software development should take a look at this book, I'm not saying that everything it's written in it has to be followed religiously, but it has very good advices and practices.
