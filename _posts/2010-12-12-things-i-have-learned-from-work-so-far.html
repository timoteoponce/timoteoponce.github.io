<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>&nbsp;Back in 2009 I started working on a Swiss software development company called <a href="http://www.swissbytes.ch/">Swissbytes</a>, since then I have learned a <b>lot</b> of things. This is a very short list of the most important ones:<br /><ul><li>You are not the best programmer in the world, deal with it.</li><li>Always put your name in your source code.</li><li>Keep track of your work, as well of your source code.</li><li>Think a little bit before jumping into programming, but do not exagerate.</li><li>Keep yourself updated, no one likes conformists.&nbsp;</li><li>Learn English, that's a <b>must do</b>.</li><li>A good specification is short and to the point.</li><li>A software product is never finished, never.</li><li>Work with standards, that's required if you are working in teams.</li><li>Write tests for your code (this is something I'm still learning).</li><li>Simplify your life, there are tools for that: revision control systems, automated build, template engines, static analysis tools.</li><li><b><span style="color: #45818e;">And the most important of all: Enjoy what you are doing, if your work does not make you happy, there's something wrong. That's the best motivational advice I could give you, enjoy your work, enjoy working on group, enjoy working alone, enjoy challenges, be proud of yourself.</span></b></li></ul><br /><ul></ul>I guess those are the most important for the moment, for sure I will be updating this list. Enjoy.
