This week has been very entertaining due to the huge amount of issues I had to dealt with, here a short summary:<br /><ul><li>I learned about the evilness about <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/148108/why-is-global-state-so-evil">Global State</a>, had to fix several issues related to it.</li><li>I got very interested (yet again) in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle">Dependency Inversion Principle</a> and finally understood it.</li><li>Started working on a very interesting project regarding a bunch of new technologies and concepts that are really exciting, some of them are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>, Maven, Spring, Scala and AOP.</li><li>Watched this great lecture on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9WtBRNydso">Biology provided by UCBerkeley</a>.</li><li>Got more and more interested in Ruby with <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>.</li><li>I learn about the difference between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian_leadership_style">Leadership and Authoritarianism</a>.</li><li><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> seems to be the way to go beyond Java, I really like its nature and it's been defined.</li><li>Learned about real Object-Oriented development with <a href="http://vimeo.com/8235651">DCI in Practice</a>.</li></ul>
