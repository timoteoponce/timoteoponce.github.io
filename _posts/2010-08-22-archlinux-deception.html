Last weekend I decided to give <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">ArchLinux</a> a chance, I only read good articles about it and I thought it would be nice to get out of <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> world.<br /><br />I will divide my experiences in a few sections:<br /><ol><li>Installation</li><ul><li> This part was really strange for me, it supposed to be easier than Slackware ncurses wizards. It's not, it's even worse.&nbsp;</li><li>I don't know if is just me, but I the default installation doesn't have anything, no media support, not extra-fs support, nothing. I don't know why ArchLinux community declares that it's painless than Slackware.</li></ul><li>Configuration</li><ul><li>A good point here, configuration of mirrors and the system in general is pretty straightforward, very simple configuration with a lot of comments. &nbsp; </li></ul><li>Package management</li><ul><li>Maybe Pacman is its best feature, it's even better(IMHO) than APT.</li></ul><li>Usability</li><ul><li>For me, it's not usable at all, I spent 2 hours to get a minimum XFCE desktop working. And don't make me talk about a work environment, it will take days!. I don't really get the idea of having such a basic environment, I don't want to install everything from scratch. But that's just me, maybe there's some other people who like to waste their time, good for them.</li></ul><li>Conclusion</li><ul><li>In general, it's not better than Ubuntu or Slackware, installation and configuration tasks are not hard, but can be simplified. Meanwhile, I will stay with my Slackware desktop for another year. </li></ul></ol>
